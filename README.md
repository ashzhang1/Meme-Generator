# Simple Meme Generator

Welcome to my Simple Meme Generator, built with React.js. You can quickly create memes by combining images and text in just a few clicks!
This is yet another small project in my React learning journey

## Features

- **Image and Text Combination**: Easily combine images and text to create custom memes that suit your sense of humor.
- **Instant Preview**: Get a real-time preview of your meme as you make changes, ensuring it looks just right before sharing.

## Key Learnings

### Calling an API (Imgflip API)

Through integrating the Imgflip API, this project provided valuable takeawats into the process of making API calls within a React.js application. I learnt how to fetch meme templates and manipulate them dynamically based on user input.

### Using useEffect

The useEffect hook in React.js played a crucial role in managing side effects within the Simple Meme Generator. It was used to update the comments within the meme based on user interactions.
